# Reddit-analysis-for-targetted-marketing
Reddit is a fast growing microblogging site like twitter, however it contains the information
in a sorted format making navigation much easier. We shall use python and the NLTK
package, along with a reddit library to browse reddit in ‘real time’ and analyze the topics by
their post content, description and comments. We can perform sentiment analysis to get
relevant information about the topic. The application of this project can be from marketing
research to social behavior analysis .
The analysis first creates an object of the sub and then provides with various graphs
indicating things like the time wise presence and usage of the sub, and how good is the sub in
its reach. A new parameter called interaction has been created for the very purpose. 
This provides a meaningful insight into how a topic is trending, what are the matters of
discussion and how the users interact. The final implementation is as a python GUI.
